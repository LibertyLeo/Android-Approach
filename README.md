# Android-Approach
This repository is born for recording android's study.  
I classify the learning projects in [demos](/Demos) while the exercise projects in [challenges](/Challenges).

# TODO
1. Limit cheat times by 3 in [LimitCheatTimes](/Challenges/GeoQuiz/GeoQuiz_ShowAPIVersionAndLimitCheatTimes).  
2. Use view type to distinguish the normal from the special view layout.(Project wasn't be created).
3. Optimize the match logic in [MatchOptimize](/Chanllengs/CriminalIntent/UpdateItemAndOptimizeMatchLogic).
4. Make respondable dialog fragment in [RespondFragment](/Chanllengs/CriminalIntent/TimePickerAndRespondableDialog).
5. Add place holder view when data is empty in [PlaceHolderView](/Chanllengs/CriminalIntent/DeleteAction_StringAdjustment_EmptyViewDesign).
6. Add action of zooming in photo, Use ViewTreeObserver to estimate the photo scale properly.
7. Add swipe to delete action for RecyclerView with the help of ItemTouchHelper class.
8. Add extra info for talkback for whether the issue has been solved, it remains existed because I think it unneccessary.  
But the rest of challenges are to fulfill the info about the related widget and automatically info the event still needs to be done.
